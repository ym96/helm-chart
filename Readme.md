This repo is built upon the forked repo from the original repo on HPCC Systems helm charts @ hpcc-systems/helm-chart

It is organized into two sections mainly:

1. aks-config -- This folder contains templates to create an AKS cluster with the desired configuration followed by cluster roles for HPCC and capability to add managed disks on a running cluster 

2. helm -- This folder contains helm chars for HPCC Systems along with storage options in Azure (Azure file and Azure disk).
